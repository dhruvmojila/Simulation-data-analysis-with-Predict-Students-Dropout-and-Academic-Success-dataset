## Project Description

**MA_540 Project** is a comprehensive analysis and implementation of various algorithms and models related to [specific topic or domain]. This project aims to [briefly describe the main objectives or goals of the project].

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Detailed steps for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Model Implementation**: Implementation of various machine learning models including [list models].
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics used to evaluate model performance such as [list metrics].
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of data and model results.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Use of Jupyter notebooks for an interactive and detailed analysis.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Running the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook MA_540_project_final.ipynb
    ```

2. **Exploring the Notebook**:
    - Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to see the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps.
    - Modify parameters and re-run cells to experiment with different settings.
